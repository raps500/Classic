# Classic - A Reimplementation of some the HP Classic Scientific calculators (HP-35, 45).

The idea is to re create these calculators in harware. The first approach is using a FPGA, the second using TTL logic (removing the "pocketability" of course). The original implementation used a bit serial architecture, I use a nibble parallel architecture.
